## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. This repository is a collection of implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms in [programming language]. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer seeking a quick reference, this repository can be a valuable resource.

## Data Structures

List the data structures included in your repository, e.g.:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs

Provide brief descriptions of each data structure and link to their respective source code files.

## Algorithms

List the algorithms included in your repository, e.g.:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
    - [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/DeveloperSwastik/Data-Structure-Algorithm/blob/main/Sorting%20Algorithms/Bubble.c)
    - [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/DeveloperSwastik/Data-Structure-Algorithm/blob/main/Sorting%20Algorithms/Insertion.c)
    - [Selection Sort](https://github.com/DeveloperSwastik/Data-Structure-Algorithm/blob/main/Sorting%20Algorithms/Selection.c)
    - [Merge Sort]()
    - [Quick Sort]()
    - [Radix Sort]()
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)

Provide brief descriptions of each algorithm and link to their respective source code files.

## Usage

Explain how to use the code provided in your repository. Include instructions on running the code, sample input and output, and any additional setup or dependencies required.
